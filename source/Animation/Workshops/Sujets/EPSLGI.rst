1.1 Introduction and motivation
"""""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Although different aspects of systems with long-range interactions have been studied in the past in specific scientific communities, notably astrophysics and plasma physics, this has not constituted a seed for more general theoretical studies. In the last decade or so, it has become progressively clear that the ubiquitous presence of long-range forces needs an approach that integrates different methodologies. This has induced a widespread interest in long-range systems throughout numerous research groups.
This workshop will bring together scientists and scholars in statistical physics, astrophysics, accelerator physics and plasma physics in order to explore the novel statistical and dynamical out-of-equilibrium properties of systems with long range interactions. In particular, the discovery of ensemble inequivalence demands for a better understanding of the physical conditions under which it is realized. Moreover, a consistent kinetic theory of long-range systems remains to be developed, which should include the full characterization of the numerically observed quasistationary states.
All this justifies the organization of the workshop in 2012: time is ripe to make significant progress in the understanding of the equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium properties of systems with long-range interactions.
The format of the workshop aims at reproducing the “old style” CECAM workshops, where a limited group of senior scientists were meeting together with juniors for a full week (or more in some cases). Seminars will be limited in number (not in duration) and placed in the mornings. Afternoons will be fully devoted to informal presentations, discussions and work. Access to the computer cluster at the Centre Blaise Pascal and to the 5000-core ENSL supercomputing center (PSMN) will be guaranteed, in order to put in (numerical) practice some of the emerging ideas. To achieve the goal of a real collaboration the blend of participants must be carefully chosen. The core of the group must be composed of persons who have already collaborated (or disagreed) in the past. Around them, a “halo” formed of fewer qualified persons in somewhat related fields, whose presence might lead to unexpected developments, should be also present.
Here we have decided to select a true plasma physicist, Dominique Escande, and an expert of disordered systems, Hidetoshi Nishimori. Escande already collaborated in the past with one of the organisers of this workshop (SR) and we have established with him already a common language (he participated in the Les Houches School quoted in the list of references). Nishimori recently wrote a series of pioneering papers extending the notion of ensemble inequivalence to the random field Ising model and to spin-glass models.
However, the workshop will be open to the participation of other scholars in these fields. In particular, some contacts will be established with researchers of the CRAL (Center of Research in Astrophysics in Lyon) working on the simulation of self-gravitating systems.

1.2 State of the art
""""""""""""""""""""

Long-range interactions are found in astrophysics, plasma physics, hydrodynamics, atomic physics, nuclear physics, solid-state physics and disordered systems. However, their statistical and dynamical properties are much less understood than those short-range interactions. If, for sufficiently large distances, the two-body potential decays with a power that is smaller or equal than space dimension, then the interaction is long-range. Our workshop will be focused on the equilibrium and outofequilibrium properties of long-range systems, relying on the tools of statistical mechanics. The aim of equilibrium statistical mechanics is to derive the thermodynamic properties of a macroscopic system from microscopic interactions: the connection between microstates and macrostates is realized through the introduction of statistical ensembles. Different thermodynamic potentials describe situations in which different thermodynamic parameters are used for the characterization of the system. However, it is usually stated, and experimentally verified for many physical systems with short-range interactions, that, as far as macroscopic averages are concerned, i.e. in the thermodynamic limit, the predictions of statistical mechanics do not depend on the chosen ensemble. Ensemble equivalence is related to the fact that, given a sufficient number of macroscopic thermodynamic parameters, the others are fixed in the large volume limit, apart from vanishingly small relative fluctuations. On the contrary, an important feature of long-range systems is that ensembles can be inequivalent. Therefore one of the main objectives of the theoretical studies of these systems is to explore the relation between the various ensembles, probe the conditions under which they become inequivalent and determine the relevant ensemble appropriate for a given Proposal : Equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium properties of systems with long-range interactions experimental setup. Ensemble inequivalence is not merely a mathematical drawback, it is the consequence of fundamental physical properties of long-range systems. Probably, one of the most striking features of long-range systems is the possibility to display negative specific heat in the microcanonical ensemble, which is a consequence of ensemble inequivalence.
As far as outofequilibrium properties are concerned, long-range systems show peculiar behaviours. The approach to equilibrium can be extremely slow: it takes place on time scales that increase with system size (while for short-range systems relaxations occur on an intensive time scale). The state of the system during this long transient is quasistationary, since its very slow time evolution allows one to define slowly varying macroscopic observables, like for local equilibrium or quasi-static transformations. The explanation of the widespread presence of quasistationary states relies upon the study of the dynamical properties of systems with long-range interactions. In the continuum limit long-range interacting systems admit a kinetic description in terms of the Vlasov equation. Within this scenario, quasistationary states correspond to stable stationary states of the Vlasov equation. The finite size system relaxes to equilibrium due to corrections of the Vlasov equation, whose study must be performed in the context of appropriately devised kinetic theories. The problem of developing a rigorous statistical mechanics treatment of quasistationary states has recently catalyzed a vigorous debate, but is still far from being solved.
A system can be driven out of equilibrium by putting it under the action of an external force or an electric field, or coupled to thermostats at different temperatures. Even in the case in which the bulk dynamics is conserving and local such systems are characterized by long-range correlations, which lead, e.g., to phase transitions and long-range order even in one dimension. In some models, features characteristic of long-range interactions, such as ensemble inequivalence have been detected. In specific cases it can even be shown that, in particular range of parameters where detailed balance is satisfied, the weight of configurations is given by an effective Hamiltonian which has explicit long-range terms. This is certainly a direction to be further explored and that can elucidate the connection between long-range correlations and long-range interactions.
