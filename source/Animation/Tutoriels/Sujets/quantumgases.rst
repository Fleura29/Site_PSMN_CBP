This workshop was dedicated to the theoretical challenges in the field of quantum gases, with a strong connection to condensed matter physics - including strongly correlated systems, low-dimensional systems, disorder effects etc. 
One of the main goals of this workshop wass to bring together young researchers coming from Europe and overseas. The program included 5 overview lectures by leading senior scientists in the field of cold atoms and condensed matter, about 20 lectures by junior scientists selected by the advisory committee, and a poster session open to all the participants. A special invited session was organized this year on the subject of Bose-Einstein condensation in condensed matter systems.
