`Les Houches physics school Website <http://houches.ujf-grenoble.fr/jsp/fiche_actualite.jsp?CODE=1284731093203&LANGUE=1&RH=AUHOU>`_

The Center of Physics organises workshops, lasting one, two or sometimes three weeks, which bring together theoreticians and experimentalists. Participants exchange knowledge and are confronted by different view points that may lead to the definition of new research programmes. Meetings of the Center of Physics are usually organised in order to leave enough time for discussion in groups that meet in small, separate work rooms.

Access 
------

* **By plane:** Geneva Airport is 1 hour drive from les Houches.

The simplest way is to use a shuttle service (approximately 40 euros up to the school, book at least three days in advance). Click here(external link) for a complete view of the different companies. Beware: We do not recommend the Alpybus company.

There is also a regular bus service between Geneva and Les Houches (only once or twice a day): http://www.coach-station.com.(external link) One should then take a taxi for the last 5 kms from the Les Houches village to the school (the total cost is similar to that of the limousine). One can also travel from Geneva to Les Houches by train (+ taxi from the train station to the School), but it is quite complicated (3 connections) and long (go through Annemasse on the French side or through Martigny on the Swiss side).

* **By train:** arrival at the Les Houches station, with one change at Saint-Gervais (from France), or at Martigny (from Switzerland). There are about 10 trains per day between St Gervais and Les Houches (schedules(external link), 20mn trip). From the Les Houches station, we strongly encourage you to take a taxi to reach the school which is about 5 kms off the station.

Taxi Garny : 06 12 35 30 72, taxi Persault : 04 50 54 41 09, taxi Carrier: 06 22 75 19 37 et taxi Servoz : 06 84 66 86 73; Participants can also contact the Les Houches school to make the reservation.

* **By road:** Les Houches are easily accessible from France (A41 highway), from Switzerland (Martigny and Col des Montets) and from Italy through the Mont Blanc Tunnel.

From Geneva and Le Fayet: 8km before Chamonix, 300 m after passing under the tunnel, bear right by the first road out for "Les Houches Bellevue". When arriving at the cable car station "Bellevue", turn right and continue upwards (roughly 2 km starting from the teleferic). 500m after the cable car station "Prarion", turn left and follow small arrows at crossroads. Continue up to the end of Route de la Côte des Chavants. Here you are! From Chamonix: bear right for "Les Houches-Chef-Lieu", turn right in Les Houches, go ahead at the cable car station "Bellevue". Then proceed as above.

Cars may be rented from Geneva and from Chamonix, it is useful to make a reservation.
