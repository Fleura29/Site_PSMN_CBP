Contents
--------

The quantitative description of degenerate and strongly correlated quantum many-body systems is the main subject of the 2014 school on computational physics. The courses will introduce the state-of-the- art approaches, e.g. quantum Monte Carlo, dynamical mean-field, and density matrix renormalization group methods. These courses will focus on the physics of ultracold atomic gases, which is particularly suited for a pedagogical introduction, as experiments directly realize fundamental models of quantum many-body theory and enable quantitative comparisons in correlation-dominated regimes. More recent developments and present trends at the interface with other condensed matter systems will be exposed in short lectures and seminars.
