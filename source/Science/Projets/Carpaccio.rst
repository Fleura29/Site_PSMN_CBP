Short description of the project
--------------------------------

.. container::

    Muscle degeneration or loss diminishes the quality of life. The causes can be genetic, disease related, accidental, environmental, or associated with aging. The study of muscle is performed in animal models around the world so as to better understand the underlying mechanisms and investigate promising new therapeutic approaches. For this, muscle cross sections are studied to determine muscle fiber number, size, gene expression and localization of the nuclei – indicators of the status of the muscle’s health and response to treatments. This process, performed manually, would take up to 8 – 12 hours per muscle. We have developed a program called *CARPACCIO* to perform automatic, objective evaluation of these parameters derived from microscope images of muscle cross sections, offering versatile representation of the data within less than 30 min. This is considered in the field as a *methodological breakthrough*.

    To make this approach available to muscle researchers around the world, we were awarded a Maturation 
    grant from `Lyon Science Transfert <http://www.universite-lyon.fr/valorisation/valorisation-134364.kjsp>`_, 
    the technology transfer office of the University of Lyon. We are developing 
    *CARPACCIO* for implementation as a Cloud computing platform (SaaS – Software as a Service) with 
    the support of the :ref:`PSMN <accueil>` under the guidance of Hervé 
    Gilquin and Loïs Taulelle, who provide the machines, the access and calculation time in close 
    collaboration with our team and external collaborators – `Sysfera <http://www.sysfera.fr/>`_ for 
    the DMZ/server interface, `CorExpert <http://www.corexpert.net/>`_ for the user/back office interface 
    and `Alter Systems <http://www.altersystems.fr/>`_ for optimization of the code in view of 
    parallelization of certain calculations. The issues of security are one of the essential aspects 
    of this multifaceted collaboration that is expertly handled by Emmanuel Quemener.
