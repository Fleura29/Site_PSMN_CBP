Project
-------

The aim of this project is the systematic study of the recently discovered “rider” coordination
behaviour of surface-adsorbed porphyrines towards carbon monoxide. The study of this
fundamentally new effect clearly constitutes an important and interesting long-term research
program that should significantly push forward the state-of-the-art in this field. This may in turn open
a new chapter in the coordination chemistry of porphyrins, with potentially important outcomes, for
example in catalysis.

Preliminary results have been already published in the prestigious Nature Chemistry, and here
systematic variations of the substrates, adsorbed species, porphyrin metal centers and ligands are
proposed in order to understand the formation of saddle-shape configuration, and how it affects the
binding of the absorbed gaz.

This project opens interesting new perspectives in the field of porphyrin’s chemistry. From the
“technological” point of view, it seems that the most important applications are to be found in the
field of catalysis. Indeed, the existence of a new coordination mode means that a different catalytic
behaviour is to be expected, with probably an increased reactivity considering the strain associated
with the “rider” ligation mode.
