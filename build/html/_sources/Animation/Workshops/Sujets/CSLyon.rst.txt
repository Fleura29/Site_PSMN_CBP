Motivation
----------

This first meeting is proposed to gather all of us who uses numerical tools to conduct their research.

The idea was simply to gather people using the same tools (quantum chemistry, molecular dynamics, monte carlo, docking, force fields...) so that we can exchange ideas, or seek some answers among neighboring people. Indeed, we sometimes feel that someone around us might already have the answer we are looking for.

Then, it may be more efficient (or friendly) to create some smaller groups depending on the topics/tools used. One follow-up could be the organizations of short workshops on given topics under the CBP guidance.

Why focusing on tools rather than research topic ? Because we also spent a lot of time on the technical/numerical aspects of our research. Thus, this "numerical gathering" comes from our day-to-day questions.
