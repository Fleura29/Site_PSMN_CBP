Abstract
--------

One day workshop will provide brief plasma physics to understand relativistic MHD (RMHD) and particle-in-cell (RPIC) simulations. The differences between two methods are discussed and some linear analysis for jet stability (Kelvin-Helmholtz, current-driven kink instability) and some recent RMHD simulation results are presented.
Some fundamental numerical techniques RPIC are discussed with some recent simulations with the Weibel instability excited by relativistic jets. We will discuss on recent developments of calculating radiation based on simulations in a self-consistent way. Some examples comparing with gamma-ray burst spectra observed by Fermi. Lectures are given in an interactive way to facilitate understanding in a short time.
