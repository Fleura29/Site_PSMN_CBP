Project
-------

PUMA MIND is an international R&D project that aims to advance the state of knowledge in designing new tools for Proton Exchange Membrane Fuel Cells (PEMFCs). 

PEMFCs are complex nonlinear systems and the project derives power mathematical models in order to improve their durability, efficiency and to reduce the cost and development time.

The mathematical models are used for command and control and offer predictive capabilities, and therefore their robustness is crucial. 

The novel mathematical models developed by PUMA MIND will be tested through experimental work in order to ensure the applicability on commercial attainable components and catalysts.

PUMA MIND is supported by the 7th Framework Programme of the European Commission in the context of the Fuel Cells and Hydrogen Joint Undertaking (FCH JU) public private partnership.
