Electrocatalysis offers an attractive means to activate CO2 through reduction. Despite recent progress in modelling electrocatalytic reactions, many methodological questions are still open and under­standing at an atomic level is scarce. However, theoretical studies provide detailed insight under very well controlled conditions and thus complement the experimental effort towards the rational design of electrocatalysts.
